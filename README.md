# welcome to the solution

Clone repo

Run `npm ci`

Run `npm start`

If "npm start" doesn't work, send us your gmail and we will add you to the Firebase project.

Then, you can run:
firebase login (login with matching gmail)

`firebase serve`

## Please note that you will need a config file to run the firebase server locally. Contact toph if you need it

To add an admin:

Once you have been added as an editor on the Firebase project,

1. Go to console.firebase.google.com
2. Click "go to console"
3. Click "AISPunchCard"
4. Click "Build" dropdown on the left
5. Click "Firestore"
6. Click "appusers" collection
7. Assuming you have already logged in and created a user, find the user
8. Set "isOfficer" to true
